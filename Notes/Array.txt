Description:

  selected by one or more indices (keys) computed at run time

Advantages:
Quick Insertion
Very Fast if index known

Disadvantages:
Slow Search
Slow Deletion

Math
- Definition: Matrix
- 	Two-dimensional grid (two-dimentional ARRAY)


Generally has two operations:
- get(A,I): the data stored in the element of the array A whose indices are
  the integer tuple I
- set(A, I, V): the array that results by setting the value of that element to
  V

In order for it to satisfy the axioms(statement taken to be true / a premise)
we must satisfy the following conditions:
- get(set(A,I, V), I) = V
- get(set(A,I, V), J) = get(A,J) if I != J
for any state A, any value V, and any tuples I,J
